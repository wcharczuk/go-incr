/*
Package incrutil provides helper types above what is already provided in incr.

These types are typically opinionated views at use cases for incr, and are not included
in the main library because they may make assumptions that don't apply in all cases.

`incr` v1.0 forward compatibility guarantees do not apply to this package, use at your own risk.
