// hold a reference to both the bind node itself and the bind's
// left-hand-side or input node. All nodes created within the bind's function
// will be associated with its scope unless they were created outside
// that scope and are simply referenced by nodes created by the bind.
//
// You shouldn't need to call [WithinScope] in practice typically, as it is

// to associate the scopes correctly. This method is exported for advanced use
// cases where you want to manage scopes manually.
